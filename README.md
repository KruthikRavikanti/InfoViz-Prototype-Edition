# Cortex Visualization Prototype

This repository contains the current React/Vite prototype for comparing brain-region alignment scores across computer vision models and then drilling into image-level evidence for selected ROI x model pairs.

## What The App Does

- Shows an aggregate heatmap of ROI x model scores.
- Lets users search and sort models.
- Opens a details panel for a selected cell.
- Ranks images by the matching ROI/model evidence column from the CSV.
- Supports compare mode for two evidence-backed cells.
- Includes a separate user study tab with an embedded form.

## Data In This Repo

The app loads data from `public/data/`:

- `murty185_zero_index.json`
  - aggregate ROI x model score matrix
- `combined_image_means.csv`
  - image-level evidence table used to rank stimuli for selected cells
- `voxel_clusters/` and `voxel_clusters_hierarchical_corr/`
  - selected model/ROI image clusters
- `visual_clusters/` and `visual_clusters_hierarchical_corr/`
  - hand-built visual feature clusters for the 185 images
- `dreamsim_clusters/` and `dreamsim_clusters_hierarchical_corr/`
  - DreamSim embedding clusters for the 185 images
- `ground_truth_clusters/` and `ground_truth_clusters_hierarchical_corr/`
  - patient/ROI ground-truth fMRI clusters

The app also serves image assets from `public/images/`.

The source DreamSim embedding bundle is stored in `data/dreamsim/dreamsim_embeddings.pth`.
It is not loaded by the browser directly; it is used by `scripts/data/cluster_runner.py` to generate the public DreamSim cluster CSV/JSON/PNG files.

## Data Scripts

Inspect the DreamSim bundle:

```bash
python scripts/data/dreamsim_pipeline.py --keys murty185
```

Regenerate DreamSim KMeans/euclidean clusters:

```bash
python scripts/data/cluster_runner.py dreamsim \
  --pth data/dreamsim/dreamsim_embeddings.pth \
  --embedding_key murty185 \
  --image_dir public/images \
  --out_dir public/data/dreamsim_clusters
```

Regenerate DreamSim hierarchical/correlation clusters:

```bash
python scripts/data/cluster_runner.py dreamsim-hierarchical \
  --pth data/dreamsim/dreamsim_embeddings.pth \
  --embedding_key murty185 \
  --image_dir public/images \
  --out_dir public/data/dreamsim_clusters_hierarchical_corr
```

## Current Evidence Coverage

The evidence pipeline is real, but partial.

- Aggregate score matrix coverage: `127` models across `ppa`, `ffa`, `eba`, and `Overall`
- Image-level evidence coverage: `26` models across `ppa`, `ffa`, and `eba`
- Image rows: `185`

This means the heatmap can show more models than the evidence panel can explain. In compare mode, the UI intentionally restricts selection to cells that have matching CSV evidence.

## Tech Stack

## Local Development

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/audreyzhao75/InfoViz-Prototype.git
   cd InfoViz-Prototype
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the app locally. Open the URL shown in your terminal (usually http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

4. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview the production build:**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Cleanup Notes

This repo previously tracked generated artifacts and dependency folders. The `.gitignore` now excludes:

- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `.DS_Store`
- TypeScript build info files

If you want the Git history to stop tracking those files, remove them from the index in a cleanup commit.
